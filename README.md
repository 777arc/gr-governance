# GNU Radio: Governance

This repository contains all the rules regarding the GNU Radio organization.

## Articles of Association

The central and most important document in this repository is the one containing
the [Articles of Association](aoa.md). These are the main rules for the GNU
Radio organization. They cannot be changed without approval from the General
Assembly (for details see the file itself). A change in the AoA would also
require the existence of a meeting minutes document that explains how the
decision was made to make the change.

## Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) describes how we desire to conduct
ourselves. The same document is part of other GNU Radio-related repositories,
including the GNU Radio core repository itself.

## By-Laws

On top of the Articles of Association, we have a set of by-laws. The bar for
changing those is lower than that for the AoA itself. These by-laws regulate
details of how the organization operates. The following by-law documents exist:

- [Voting Procedures](voting.md)

## Minutes

For every General Assembly and for every online vote done by the General
Assembly, minutes will be taken and documented in the `minutes/` subdirectory.

This is also where changes are explained and justified.
