# Contributing

This repository is not meant for general contributions. Changes to the articles
of association, the by-laws, or the code of conduct require agreement by the
board, the general assembly, or other governing bodies. This git repository is
used to track the changes for posterity, and to track the evolution of these
rules over time.

Pull Requests will generally be declined or tagged spam, unless initiated by an
active member of the GNU Radio organization as part of regular GNU Radio
organization activities.
